# The Preston Method
*Systematic approach to preventing LLM telephone and research perfectionism in AI workflows*

## What is LLM Telephone?

LLM Telephone is the phenomenon where asking multiple AI models to "improve" or "refine" each other's responses leads to degraded accuracy despite improved polish. Like the childhood telephone game, information becomes less accurate with each handoff.

**The Pattern:**
- First AI: 80% accuracy, rough edges
- Second AI "improvement": 70% accuracy, smoother
- Third iteration: 40% accuracy, perfectly polished fiction

## The Preston Method Core Principles

1. **Good Enough to Act Rule**: Can you make a decision or take action? If yes, stop.
2. **80% Rule**: The first LLM response is usually the most honest
3. **Time Boxing**: Hard stops prevent perfectionism spirals
4. **Single Model Sessions**: Prevent model-hopping behavior

## Background

Developed while conducting AI research as a stay-at-home dad and AI hobbyist. Identified the problem through practical use with baby daughter in one arm, leading to systematic approach for research efficiency.

## Status

Methodology in active development. Full automation toolkit planned for 2025.
